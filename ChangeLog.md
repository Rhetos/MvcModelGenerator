# MvcModelGenerator release notes

## 3.2.0 (TO BE RELEASED)

### Breaking changes

* Removed compilation for Rhetos.Mvc.dll and Captions.dll. To retain the same functionality you will have to use MSBuild or Visual Studio to generate the two assemblies. Follow the below instructions to generate the missing assemblies:

  * Create a Visual studio solution or use an existing one
  * In the solotion create a class libraray project with the name **Captions** that should target at least .NET Standard 2.0
  * Open the **Captions.csproj** file and the add follwoing code

    ```xml

    <ItemGroup>
        <Compile Include="path to generated Captions.cs" Link="Captions.cs" />
    </ItemGroup>

    <ItemGroup>
        <EmbeddedResource Include="path to generated Captions.resources" Link="Captions.resources" LogicalName="Captions.resources" />
    </ItemGroup>

    ```

    The files generated by the package Rhetos.Mvc.Modelgenerator are located in the `obj\Rhetos\RhetosAssets` folder.

  * Create another project with the name **Rhetos.Mvc** that should target at least .NET Standard 2.0. In this project add the reference to the **Captions** project and to the nuget package **Rhetos.Mvc.Client 3.2.0**.
  * In the **Rhetos.Mvc** project add

    ```xml

    <ItemGroup>
        <Compile Include="path to generated Rhetos.Mvc.cs" Link="Rhetos.Mvc.cs" />
    </ItemGroup>

    ```

  * Building the solution should generate the **Captions.dll** and **Rhetos.Mvc.dll** assemblies

## 3.1.0 (2020-10-19)

* Build optimization: Sorting entries in Captions.resx file to avoid unnecessary rebuilds of Captions.dll and Rhetos.Mvc.dll.

## 3.0.0 (2020-09-23)

* Upgrade to Rhetos 4.0.
* Build optimization: Caching of resources to avoid recompilation of unchanged captions.

## 2.5.0 (2020-05-14)

* Support for Rhetos 4.0: New interface for generating 'assets' assembly files that are not part of the main application.

## 2.4.0 (2019-09-16)

## Internal improvements

* Bugfix: Deployment on Rhetos v3 fails with FileNotFoundException: Could not find file 'C:\My Projects\Rhetos\Source\Rhetos\bin\System.dll'.

## 2.3.0 (2019-09-09)

### New features

* New DSL concept: **ImplementInMvcModel**, for implementing an interface in the generated MVC model class.
